                    <li class="mt-3"><b>3. Payment:</b> Establishment of this service is dependent upon receipt by the Company of payment of stated charges. Subsequent payments are due on the anniversary date of the month for that month’s service. Subscriber agrees that VSRO+ automatically charges subscriber credit card every month. VSRO+ reserves the right to process client credit cards from 1 to 5 days before the actual due date to ensure that the funds are received by the due date. It is important to understand that all the payments must come from the customer itself and not from third parties, failure to do so may result in suspension of the services.

If a dispute or claim gets open instead of properly requesting the cancellation of the services, all the services related with the company are going to be completely terminated without further notice as this is a direct violation for the pre-paid model of all our services.
